# SpeakeasyOnline
Speakeasy is a card game I developed with one road trip and a clipboard.  You're a gangster in the 1920s trying to run a speakeasy and drive your rivals out of business.  Each card represents a different type of gangster you can hire to help you out.  You'll have to manage resources like cash, booze, information on other gangsters, it plays a bit like Magic the Gathering.  SpeakeasyRules.docx has the complete rules for the game.

Start the game by running main.py or a dedicated server by running server.py.  Currently there's no menu.

Card images lovingly taken from the Windows XP card games, you can find the sprite sheet I used in Data/CardsSmall.  I intend on replacing them at some point with ones that better reflect the gangster types, but that's gonna take some time.
